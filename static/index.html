                        We are about to study the idea of a computational process.
                        Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers.
                        As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data.
                        The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program.
                        People create programs to direct processes.
                        In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        A computational process is indeed much like a 
sorcerer's idea of a spirit.
                        It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed
 of matter at all.
                        However, it is very real. It can perform 
intellectual work. It can answer questions.
                        It can affect the world by disbursing money at a
 bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory.
                        The programs we use to conjure processes are 
like a sorcerer's spells.
                        They are carefully composed from symbolic 
expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe 
the tasks we want our processes to perform.

                Let's use Racket (a modern scheme implementation) for working through SICP.<br>
                Download and install from <a href="https://download.racket-lang.org/">https://download.racket-lang.org/</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Racket has a SICP mode to accompany the book.<br>

                    This package contains two collections.<br>
                    The sicp collection contains a #lang sicp language 
ideal for studying the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer 
Programs" by Gerald Jay Sussman and Hal Abelson.<br>
                    The book is usually referred to simply as SICP.<br>
                    The second sicp-pict collection contains the picture language used in SICP.<br>

            <p>
                Once you have racket installed, follow the instructions from <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html">https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html</a> to get the SICP language pack installed.<br>
                The racket installer includes DrRacket, an IDE with a 
text editor, debugger, REPL, package manager interface, and more.
